For the user interface, we use both HTML and CSS stylesheet. For programming languages, we use javascript and python. For the framework, our team chooses the flask over other packages  because flask is a microframework so it is easy to implement and fits a light application which our project is, also since Flask uses python it is easier to learn how to use it. For the database, our team uses SQLite and sqlalchemy to interact with the database. Besides those, we also use AJAX, the advantage is that it allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes which enhances the flexibility of our project.
