As a logged in user I want to see the stocks that I have searched previously. The user can check their history with a button. There will be a button on the UI interface, when a user clicks on it, they will be directed to a webpage that gives charts and data showing the revenue the user has made from each stocks, the stocks the users have chosen, and the types of stocks the user prefers.
