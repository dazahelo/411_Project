As a logged in user I want to be able to purchase an amount of stocks on the webpage. Then I will notice there are a purchase button and a box for user to enter the number of stocks at the bottom of the name of the stock. After I click on it and enter the box, we would make a call to the API to get the prices from the stock, then there will be a purchase record in my history, and your the my user revenue will be calculated. There will be history of your purchase date, and the revenue will be calculated after that. However, this action doesnâ€™t really purchase the stock in reality, they are virtual practice for user to learn to buy stocks.
