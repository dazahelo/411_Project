The project that we have on mind is to create a program that would take information from two different stock markets website, and would use this data in order to predict the stock prices. For the data base we are thinking of using mongodb. The API's that we would be using are going to be the two stock markets websites. Then for the third party authentication we are planning in doing a python file that would serve as our google account authentication. For the decoupled architecture, we would be using the RESTful interface where the front end is going to be Flask and the back end is going to be SQLAlchemy. Besides that, content of data will be rendered on html with css and javascript files.
