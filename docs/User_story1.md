As a user I would like to login to the website. The user would try to log in with the options to put their username and password, then there should be three options, one is to log in successfully meaning that the account has been created and the information was correct, the second option would be that the user is unable to log in for wrong information ( this would prompt the user with a msg saying that “either the password or username is incorrect”). Lastly, if the user doesn’t have an account it would tell the user that there is not an account associated with that username and would guide it to the place where they can create an account
