As a logged in user, I want to search for a specific stock or market and see the predicted price for the next day. There would be two options for this, the first one would be that the stock or market that they search exists and it would show the price for the next day, the other would be that the stock or market doesn’t exist and would prompt the user with an error msg stating that “this market doesn’t exist”.
