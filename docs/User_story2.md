As a logged in user, I want to search for a specific market or stock and get a predicted price for a day. There would be two options for this, the first one would be that the market or stock that they search exists and it would ask them the day that they want the price for, after choosing this it would call the API where it would get the prices and this would give the user the predicted price, the other would be that the market or stock doesn’t exist and would prompt the user with an error msg stating that “this market/stock doesn’t exist”.
