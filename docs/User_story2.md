As a logged in user, I want to search for a specific market and ask for a predicted price for a day. There would be two options for this, the first one would be that the market that they search exists and it would ask them the day that they want the price for, after choosing this it would give them the predicted price, the other would be that the market doesn’t exist and would prompt the user with an error msg stating that “this market doesn’t exist”.
