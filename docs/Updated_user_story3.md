As a logged in user I want to practice buying stocks. The user would be able to put the name of the stock, but before creating the stock they would be able to put the amount that they want to “buy”, when they do this the user would be able to see their profit for that specific stock as the days go by. These can be done for multiple stocks and the user would be able to see all of them.
